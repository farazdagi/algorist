## To Do

- [x] `.gitignore` (to ignore bundled)
- [ ] `justfile` to minimize typing requirements
- [ ] Document existing algorithms and data structures.
  - [ ] `math`
    - [x] `primes`
    - [ ] `gcd`
    - [ ] `root`
    - [ ] `modulo`
    - [ ] `log`
  - [ ] `ext`
  - [ ] `collections`
  - [ ] `misc`
- [ ] Provide `examples`, with a CodeForces contest as an example.
- [ ] Replace RegEx bundler with one using AST.
- [ ] How to contribute (and develop your own version of library).
- [ ] Plan extension of the library with more algorithms and data structures.
- [ ] Allow re-exports (expose primes in math module and make sure that bundling works)
- [ ] Return back `rustfmt.toml` that groups modules by category.
- [ ] Allow to use external `algos` lib -- ensure that `include_dir` compatible template source is used.
