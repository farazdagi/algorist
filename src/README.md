Algorithms and data structures for competitive programming.

There are numerous algorithms and data structures that can be useful in competitive programming.

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`io`](io) | Input/output helpers, including `Scanner` for reading input and `Writer` for writing output. |
| [`math`](math) | Mathematical algorithms, such as number factorization, primality tests, GCD, modular arithmetic, etc. |
| [`ext`](ext) | Extensions to standard library types. |
| [`collections`](collections) | Additional collections like 2D-arrays, trees, graphs etc. |
| [`misc`](misc) | Miscellaneous algorithms and data structures, not fitting into other categories. |
